After connecting the Arduino to power and wiring up the board as shown in the Fritzing file, this board will represent a 5-bit binary number.
The number counts up at a speed determined by the potentiometer.
Every bit of the number is represented by a different light.
1: Red
2: Red
4: Yellow
8: Yellow
16:Green
The number will count up from 0 to 31, the maximum the display can represent. After reaching 31, it will overflow back to 0.
